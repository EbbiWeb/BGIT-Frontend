1. Explain the concept of closures in JavaScript. Provide an example and discuss why closures are important in modern JavaScript development.

Closures are functions that can access values outside of their curly braces. Closures are important to preventing data leakage.

2. Describe the differences between var, let, and const in JavaScript. When would you use each of them? Provide examples to illustrate your answer.

var = variables are function-scoped and therefore are only accessible within the function in which they are defined.
let = allows for block-level scoping for variables, making them exclusively accessible from within the block in which they are defined.
const = once assigned a value, constants cannot be modified or reassigned. Therefore const variables hold a fixed value and similar to let, const variables follow block-scoping rules.

3. What are higher-order functions in JavaScript? Provide an example of a higher-order function and explain its usage.

A higher-order function is one that can accept or return other functions. One of the biggest benefits are that they are easy to reuse and enhance code simplicity.

4. Explain the concept of state and props in React. How do they differ, and how are they used in React component development?

State is a built-in object which enables components to create and manage their own data. Props on the other hand, short for properties, are used to pass data between components.

5. Discuss the concept of component lifecycle methods in React. Provide a brief overview of some commonly used lifecycle methods and when they are invoked during the component's lifecycle
